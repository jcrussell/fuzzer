fuzzer
======

A simple fuzzer for educational purposes.


Usage
-----

mutate.py TEMPLATE PROGRAM

This fuzzer will mutate TEMPLATE and run PROGRAM on the mutations. The only
mutation that's currently available replaces bytes in the input with random
bytes based on a probability. Run "mutate.py -h" for more usage info.


Improvements
------------

* Add a mode that increments/decrements bytes instead of replacing with random
  a value.
* Add ASCII-only mode for programs with ASCII inputs.
